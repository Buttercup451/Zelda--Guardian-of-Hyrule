After the Battle of the Lost Woods,

the darkness had the advantage of
having the higher ground. There was
only one way up the Mountain and
the Royal Army knew they had the
disadvantage.
However, they strongly believed
their numbers would outweigh their
disadvantage and thought that they
could wipe out the darkness once
and for all.

The Royal Army began their ascent
up Death Mountain, but were quickly
met with a large opposing force.
The darkness had a significantly
larger army than previously thought
by the Royal Army.
The group of men that went up Death
Mountain were slain within mere

However, they also knew that if the
darkness was after the Eastern
Desert, then there was a good

The darkness was surrounding Hyrule
Castle.
General Damon was the one who
discovered this as he lead the
attack on the Great Swamp.
However, the tide was quickly
turning against him and his men, so
he sent off one last message
through one of his men that went

This battle took place within the

receiving General Damon's message,
the King took all of his subjects
and put them within the castle
walls. There was no one else for
the people to run and the remainder
of the army couldn't protect
the people if they were spread out.
All who had wanted to run did so
and left the Kingdom. Everyone else
remained within the walls of the
castle as the darkness began its
attack on Hyrule Castle.

The battle started at the front
gate and then spread out around the
castle walls. Although the Royal
Army fought bravely, they could not
hold off the darkness forever.
Eventually, the darkness breached
the front gate and soon swarmed the
Castle, killing everyone in sight.

The four remaining Generals began
evacuating everyone through a
secret exit that lead to an
underground tunnel. The Generals
themselves, however, did not go
through.
One single soldier of the darkness
reached the throne room and the
four Generals attempted to fight
him off to protect the King.
Despite their bravery, however,
they could not hold the soldier off
and eventually all four of them
were dead. The soldier then killed
the King. All hope had been lost.

entrance to Death Mountain and the
darkness knew that if they lost

for them to achieve victory.

During the battle, the Royal Army
attempted a stealth mission lead by
General Marcus while creating a
diversion elsewhere. Unfortunately,

Only General Marcus remained.

This battle is also known as the
Final Battle for it is indeed the

After the Battle of Hyrule Castle,
it was assumed that the Royal Army
was dead, but they were wrong.
When the soldier killed the King,
he had, for an unknown reason,
decided to take his soldiers back
to the sanctuary. It was then that
two Hylian women rose up with an
already established group of
followers. They lead an attack on
the Sanctuary with their followers.

All of the remaining forces of the
darkness were outside the Sanctuary
waiting for them and a large battle
ensued. Not long after, the two
women managed to get inside the
Sanctuary, but for some reason
decided to prevent anyone else from
getting inside.

It is unknown exactly what happened
inside the walls of the Sanctuary.
Not long after the two women went
inside, a ball of bright light
quickly surround the Sanctuary.
This light then knocked everyone
unconscious within its vacinity.
When everyone woke up, the darkness
was gone amd the women had gone.
During the following years, Hyrule
was rebuilt upon the ruins of the
Old Kingdom.

away the Golden Land.
Zelda is the heiress of
that power. She used it

masters the Triforce's
